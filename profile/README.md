📋- WHO ARE ATLAS PLUGINS?
----
Atlas Plugins is a small team of two friends who have created 
custom plugins for their privet hosted SMP server for us and
are friends to play and enjoy the game more with more goals 
to work towards adding funny but exciting things to the 
game to make it more enjoyable.

📢- WHY YOU MAKING THE PLUGINS PUBLIC?
---
We are making the plugins public because 
we think other people who are creating SMP servers 
for their friends to play or for a public server 
will enjoy the plugins we have created too 
to make their SMP server a little more exciting.
